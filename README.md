- Weather details screen to display:
  - City name
  - Current temperature (in Celsius)
  - Weather condition (e.g., cloudy, sunny, rainy)
  - An icon representing the weather condition
  - Humidity percentage
  - Wind speed
- "Refresh" button on the weather details screen to fetch updated weather data
- Data persistence using `shared_preferences` to save and load the last searched city
